# Sales-Data-Analytics-Azure-Data-Engineering-End-to-End-Project(Retail Sales Insights on Azure)

# Project Overview:

This project simulates a real-world business scenario for a Retail company that wants to modernize its data architecture and gain actionable insights from its sales, customer, and inventory data stored in an on-premise SQL Server database.
I built a complete cloud-native Data Engineering solution using Microsoft Azure tools. The goal was to migrate raw operational data to the cloud, transform it using ETL best practices, store it in a centralized enterprise-grade warehouse, and present insights via an interactive Power BI dashboard  empowering business teams to make data-driven decisions.


## 🎯 Business Problem

A fictional **retail retail company** faces reporting delays, data silos, and inconsistent KPIs. This solution was developed to:

- Automate ingestion and transformation of daily sales and customer data.
- Enable centralized, cloud-based analytics.
- Deliver interactive dashboards to empower business teams with actionable insights.



## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a scalable, cloud-native, real-time data engineering pipeline that ingests weather and air quality data every 30 seconds, processes it using Azure Databricks, streams it via Event Hub, securely manages credentials with Key Vault, and delivers live insights and alerts through Power BI and Azure Data Activator.
