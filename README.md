# Sales-Data-Analytics-Azure-Data-Engineering-End-to-End-Project

# Project Overview:

This project simulates a real-world business scenario for a Retail company that wants to modernize its data architecture and gain actionable insights from its sales, customer, and inventory data stored in an on-premise SQL Server database.
I built a complete cloud-native Data Engineering solution using Microsoft Azure tools. The goal was to migrate raw operational data to the cloud, transform it using ETL best practices, store it in a centralized enterprise-grade warehouse, and present insights via an interactive Power BI dashboard  empowering business teams to make data-driven decisions.
